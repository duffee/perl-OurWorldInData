=head1 SYNOPSIS

    my $chart = WebService::OurWorldInData::Chart->new({
        chart => 'sea-surface-temperature-anomaly', # dataset name
    });

    my $result = $chart->data(); # get the csv data
    my $rows = $chart->parse_data($result);

=head1 DESCRIPTION

Queries the Our World in Data Chart api which provides data and metadata
in CSV format. The Chart object can be created with the following attributes:

short_names - a boolean flag to affect the results
csv_type - either full (default) or filtered
time/country - filter the results you request

as described by the OWiD API.

    my $chile = WebService::OurWorldInData::Chart->new(
                    chart => 'life-expectancy',
                    csv_type => 'filtered',
                    country => '~CHL',
                    time => '1998..2023' );

=head1 Methods

=head2 find

Our World in Data holds the data on 14,368 charts across 123 topics
as of July 2025. Because they haven't opened up their Catalog API yet,
I've had to scrape their web page for results. This means that the
C<find> method is not dynamic, up-to-date or anywhere near complete.

There are currently 1822 charts known by this module.

=head2 get_topics

This will return a list of topics that I've scraped so far.
It is not the complete 123 as of July 2025, but it should
give you a start.
